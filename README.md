# Artemis Financial Secure Software Report

## Summary

**Client and Software Requirements**  
Artemis Financial is a company focused on helping clients manage their financial information securely. They needed help strengthening their software security and asked us to assess vulnerabilities and fix any weaknesses in their codebase. Their goal was to make sure their systems could protect sensitive client data and meet best practices for secure coding.

**Software Security Work**  
While working on Artemis Financial's project, I found and identified security vulnerabilities effectively by running scans and manually reviewing parts of the code. I made sure that sensitive areas like input validation, cryptography, and client/server interactions were looked at closely. It’s important to code securely because it protects a company’s reputation, builds client trust, and keeps sensitive data safe. Strong security makes a company much more resilient overall.

**Challenges and Helpful Parts**  
One part of the vulnerability assessment that stood out was working through the cryptography checks. It helped me understand where encryption could go wrong and how important key management is. Some parts of the testing process were time-consuming but gave me good practice finding hidden issues.

**Adding Layers of Security**  
I increased layers of security by applying SSL to secure communications and running static analysis tools to catch vulnerabilities. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP Dependency Check and automated static analysis scanners, combined with manual code reviews, to prioritize and pick the right mitigation techniques.

**Functionality and Security Testing**  
To make sure the software stayed functional and secure, I tested the application after changes and reran security scans. After refactoring, I checked for any new vulnerabilities by comparing reports from before and after and made sure nothing new showed up.

**Resources and Tools**  
I used tools like OWASP Dependency Check, keytool, and static analysis reports to help guide my refactoring work. Secure coding practices like avoiding hardcoded credentials and using proper input validation will be helpful in future assignments too.

**Portfolio Value**  
For future employers, I would show the secure software report and the refactored project with its security improvements. It shows I know how to find vulnerabilities, fix them, and maintain functionality, which are important skills for any software development role.
